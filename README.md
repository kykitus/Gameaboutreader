Here you can experience the terminal game (still in develpment)

This is game

Not a dog

Cats better

But also not a cat

This game is about some guy

Let's tell it is about you reader

Game about reader

Do comments even exist in github?

Code in this game is yes

I plan to change names of variables after completing this game (and add comments over time)

But it isn't finished yet

So until proabably June, you have exclusive oppurtunity to see this exclusive content of exclusive variable names


How to open game:
- all is required is all txt files to be in same folder as exe file (or rest of source files if game is opened with MVS)


From now, things that should work is:
- Shop
- fight (no ai and consumables)
- Stats menu
- Lvl up sustem
- Equipment managment system (lucky items still in development)
- Save/Load menu
- 

Things that I want do to finish this game is:
- More items
- More enemy names
- Fight system
- Armor types
- Fix bugs if there are (definiely there are)

Currently working on:
- Fight system
- Consumables system
- equipment (i think it would be good if game would not have only test equipment)
