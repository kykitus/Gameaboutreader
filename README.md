# myfirstshitgame
Here you can experience the game (still in develpment)

This is game

Not a dog

Cats better

But also not a cat

This game is about some guy

Let's tell it is about you reader

Game about reader

Do comments exist even in github?

Code in this game is yes

I plan to change names of variables after completing this game (and add comments over time)

But it isn't finished yet

So until proabably June, you have excluive oppurtunity to see this exclusive content of exclusive variable names



From now, things that should work is:
- Shop (unfished)
- Both main and shop menus
- Stats menu
- Equipment (lucky items still in development) managment system 

Things that I want do to finish this game is:
- More items
- More enemy names
- Save/Load system
- Lvl up system
- Consumables system
- Fight system
- Fix bugs if there are (definiely there are)
