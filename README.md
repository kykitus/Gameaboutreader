Game about reader

Do comments even exist in github?

Code in this game is yes

I plan to change names of variables after completing this game (and add comments over time)

But it isn't finished yet

So until proabably June, you have exclusive oppurtunity to see this exclusive content of exclusive variable names


How to open game:
- all is required is all txt files to be in same folder as exe file (or rest of source files if game is opened with MVS)

Things that I want do to finish this game is:
- nothing, it's finished (yay)

Currently working on:
- many many math calculations that would convice me to release an DLC

New patch called:
Finally!

Log:
It's finally here.... the game. Even through it took 8.5 months to finish simple game on terminal, I feel proud of myself. I really want to thank that one guy that watched me for 3 months caus it actually encouraged me to keep working at it. Now i will be starting with Unreal to try actual serious things in game development. But this journey wasn't ended. It starts from this mile stone and maybe some years later it will be revived as actual game somewhere or even evolve into something interesing. A game that will may have some both positive and negative reviews that would have important impact on further development. Maybe I will stop being lazy or slow enough to make simple terminal game in 8.5 months. Or go opposite and will be breaking through records oldest games in alpha at speed of light. Again, thank you. :>
